NAME
    Regexp::Grammars::Common::String - Some basic String parsing Rules for
    Regexp::Grammars

VERSION
    version 0.01000003

SYNOPSIS
        use Regex::Grammars;
        use Regexp::Grammars::Common::String;

        my $re = qr{

            (.*<[String]>)+

            <extends: Regexp::Grammars::Common::String>

        }x; #  don't forget the x!

            ...

        if( $content =~ $re ){
            print Dumper( \%/ ); # Praying Mantis operator!?
        }

DESCRIPTION
    Regexp::Grammars is just too useful to not use, but too pesky and
    confusing for new people.

    Some of the more complex things involve string extraction and
    escape-handling, and I seriously spent the better part 2 hours learning
    how to make this work. So, even if this module is not immediately
    useful, it may serve as an educational tool for others.

    I probably should have delved deeper into the Regexp::Common Family, but
    I couldn't find one in there that did exactly what I wanted.

    At present, this module only provides one rule, "String", but I will
    probably add a few more later.

GRAMMARS
  Regexp::Grammars::Common::String
        <extends: Regexp::Grammars::Common::String>

RULES
  String
    For parsing strings like so:

        "Hello"     => 'Hello'
        "Hel\lo"    => 'Hello'
        "Hel\\lo"   => 'Hel\lo'
        "Hel\"lo"   => 'Hel"lo'

    It should do a reasonable job of picking up strings from files and
    properly returning their parsed contents.

    It made sense to me to drop the excess "\"'s that are used for escaping,
    in order to get a copy of the string as it would be seen to anything
    else that parsed it properly and evaluated the escapes into characters.
